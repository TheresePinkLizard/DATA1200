            <h2>PAOLO MATTEUZZI</h2>
            <p>STUDIO Zaha Hadid Architects</p>
            
            <p>
                Just as in the design of a supercar,
                high-tech architecture is always pushing
                the boundaries, in terms of both stylis-
                tic research and the conception and use
                of revolutionary materials. Zaha Hadid
                Architects (ZHA) has been promot-
                ing innovation and new codes for years
                without ever forgetting the demands of
                tradition. The future development of
                techniques for the construction of com-
                plex architectures will hardly be able to 
                avoid drawing on projects such as the
                Morpheus Hotel in Macao of the Leeza
                SOHO office tower in Beijing. The lat-
                ter not only features the tallest atrium in
                history, but also a fascinating twisting
                movement that optimizes the exposure
                of the façade. The Morpheus Hotel, on
                the other hand, represents the highest
                point of parametric research and owes its
                formal qualities to computational design
                tools in conjunction with robotic pro-
                duction methods. This research opened
                up the possibility of radically surpassing
                the Fordist model linked to mass produc-
                tion, with almost identical buildings, to
                arrive at the customization of the prod-
                uct, even on a large scale. 
                Today, the search for aesthetic perfec-
                tion that pursues beauty as an absolute
                value has definitively waned compared
                to the value that all the components of
                the project, together, must achieve. If it is
                true that beauty will save the world, then
                it is the concept of beauty itself that must
                be investigated.
                The transformation of cities will soon
                be linked to mobility infrastructures that
                are no longer physical, but media-based.
                And the cars of the future will also have 
                to adapt to it. The freedom to drive one´s
                own vehicle is driverless era, cars will be
                controlled by an algorithm, and it will
                become more and more the privilege of 
                the few to actually get into a car, put
                their hands on the wheel and drive aimlessly, 
                desiring only that the car gives us
                the most exciting and immersive experience.
