<div><p>Just as in the design of a supercar,
    high-tech architecture is always pushing
    the boundaries, in terms of both stylis-
    tic research and the conception and use
    of revolutionary materials. Zaha Hadid
    Architects (ZHA) has been promot-
    ing innovation and new codes for years
    without ever forgetting the demands of
    tradition. The future development of
    techniques for the construction of com-
    plex architectures will hardly be able to 
    avoid drawing on projects such as the
    Morpheus Hotel in Macao of the Leeza
    SOHO office tower in Beijing. The lat-
    ter not only features the tallest atrium in
    history, but also a fascinating twisting
    movement that optimizes the exposure
    of the façade. The Morpheus Hotel, on
    the other hand, represents the highest
    point of parametric research and owes its
    formal qualities to computational design
    tools in conjunction with robotic pro-
    duction methods. This research opened
    up the possibility of radically surpassing
    the Fordist model linked to mass produc-
    tion, with almost identical buildings, to
    arrive at the customization of the prod-
    uct, even on a large scale. 
    Today, the search for aesthetic perfec-
    tion that pursues beauty as an absolute
    value has definitively waned compared
    to the value that all the components of
    the project, together, must achieve. If it is
    true that beauty will save the world, then
    it is the concept of beauty itself that must
    be investigated.
    The transformation of cities will soon
    be linked to mobility infrastructures that
    are no longer physical, but media-based.
    And the cars of the future will also have 
    to adapt to it. The freedom to drive one´s
    own vehicle is driverless era, cars will be
    controlled by an algorithm, and it will
    become more and more the privilege of 
    the few to actually get into a car, put
    their hands on the wheel and drive aim-
    lessly, desiring only that the car gives us
    the most exciting and immersive experi-
    ence.
